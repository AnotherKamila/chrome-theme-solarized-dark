Solarized Dark for Chrome/Chromium
==================================

All credit for the awesome color scheme goes to Ethan Schoonover (see <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>).

Installation
------------

[Click here](https://github.com/downloads/AnotherKamila/chrome-theme-solarized-dark/chrome-theme-solarized-dark.crx) for the CRX (you will be asked whether to apply it once the download finishes).

To install from source, you need to open the extensions page (<chrome://extensions>) and enable Developer mode if needed. In Developer mode, there is a button 'Load unpacked extension', just use that to select the folder.

Why Doesn't it Look Perfect?
----------------------------

Because Chrome themes have limited capabilities. (Note: it has nothing to do with me!). At some point I will create a user stylesheet to complement the theme, and also attempt to fix the remaining details once I find out whether and how they can be fixed.

Here are some of the questions:

- **the address bar** -- on Linux, how to change the background color?
- **the `#footer` background on the NTP** -- can it be changed?
